Configuring Laptops with Ansible

==================================================

Setting up a new laptop can be disorienting. It's easy to forget all the
little configuration tweaks that accumulated over time. With only a
little work upfront, a configuration management system can turn those
notes into executable documentation, making it easy to reproduce a
heavily customized setup on other laptops down the line.

While there are several configuration management systems, I am going to
focus on Ansible, because it's easy to set up locally. No experience
with Ansible or other configuration management tools systems is assumed.
